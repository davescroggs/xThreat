### Pass networks to do

 - There's often information about a kick afterwards, need to include. Most often when the kick doesn't go to a player (ie. goal, out of bounds)
      - Need to get the last disposal (Kick, Handball, Ground Kick) and see if there's anything after it

 - Readme/landing page
 - Viz passing network (network diagrams in python)
 - Viz chains
    - Remove superflous events, just keep the ones important for understanding
 - Viz footy oval (with/without normalised values?)
   - Early version = DONE
   - Flatten the goal line, add goal + point posts
 - summarise effective disposal position for each player
 - build xThreat model based on whether 
 - Think about cacluating a delta threat before and after possession
 - Get most effective possession in a given game
 - Add information about free kicks in possessions (not start)
 - Determine continuity/discontiuity between posessions for start and end position calculations
